# Therapeutic Opportunities in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Mechanistic Dissection of Host-Microbiome Relationships

- Authors: Plichta et al.
- Journal: Cell, 2019

## 1. The current state of treatment: challenges posed
- Two major types of IBD
    - Ulcerative colities (UC)
    - Crohn's disease (CD)
- UC
    - restricted to the colon
- CD
    - can involve entire depth of tissue
- Not always clear cut if a disease is UC or CD (could be a blend)
- Types of therapies
    - aminosalicylates
    - corticosteroids
    - immunomodulators
    - janus kinase inhibitors
    - monoclonal antibodies targeting
        - TNF-$\alpha$
        - IL-12/23
        - integrins to inflammatory pathways
- two challenges
    - further need for mechanistic understanding of disease drivers
        - incorporate heterogeneity, host genetics, and microbiome
    - renewed classification system based on clinical, molecular, and AI methods

## 2. IBD genetics and functional links to the microbiome
- Studies of IBD genetics have 200 loci that only explan 8-13% of disease susceptibility variance
    - highlights importance of non-genetic modifiers
- Both hyper and deficient immune system phenotypes are associated with IBD
- A chronic low-grade inflammatory intestinal environment can significantly impact the microbiome by selecting against species sensitive to inflammation and promoting blooms of functionally adapted species
- Fungal mycobiome also affects IBD
- Need to strengthen associations between gut microbiome (metagenomics) and human genetics

## 3. Mechanisms of adaptive immunity towards microbiome antigens
- robust assocation between host immunity and microbial infection centers around **human leukocyte antigen (HLA)**

## 4. Microbiome-encoded molecular patterns condition host immunity

## 5. Pharmacology of microbiome-derived metabolites and host targets

## 6. Microbiome-inspired therapeutics
