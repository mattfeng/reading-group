# Variation in Microbiome LPS Immunogenicity Contributes to Autoimmunity in Humans (Cell 2016)

- **hygiene hypothesis**. early exposure to specific microorganisms and parasites in infancy benefits immune system development and builds protection against allergic and autoimmune diseases
- studies in mouse models show that early colonization with a _protective microbiota_ can diminish the risk of autoimmune diabetes development in genetically susceptible animals
- distinction between beneficial and harmful microbial communities and the functional mechanisms underlying their effects are still poorly understood
