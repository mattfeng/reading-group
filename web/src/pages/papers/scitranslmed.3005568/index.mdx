# Cell-Based Therapeutics: The Next Pillar of Medicine

- Key step that will _enable the emergence of cell therapy_: **development of cellular engineering as a foundational science**
- Cellular engineering tools:
    - mechanisms for editing and recoding genomes
    - a toolkit of molecular parts and regulatory modules that behave predictably
    - systems-based theoretical framework for tuning and optimizing cellular behaviors

## Why cells are suited for therapeutics
- Cells naturally perform therapeutic tasks.
    - e.g. macrophages
    - e.g. stem cells
    - e.g. pancreatic $\beta$ cells
