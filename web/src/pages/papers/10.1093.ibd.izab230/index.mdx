# Research-Based Product Innovation to Address Critical Unmet Needs of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD 2021)

## Unmet patient needs
1. biomarkers for prognosis of disease course and prediction/monitoring of treatment response
2. restoration of eubiosis
3. restoration of barrier function and mucosal healing
4. more effective and safer anti-inflammatories
5. neuromodulatory and behavioral therapies
6. management of disease complications
7. targeted drug delivery

- irreversible bowel damage and complications such as strictures or fistulas are very difficult to treat once they develop, and commonly recur after surgery
- response to treatment is variable
    - approximately 30% to 40% of patients are primary nonresponders
    - 30% are secondary nonresponders to biologics
- clinicians lack validated and minimally invasive biomarkers for
    - prognostication of disease course
    - prediction of treatment response
    - monitoring of mucosal healing

## Possible solutions
1. identification of new therapeutic targets linked to IBD pathology so that treatments can be tailored to the biology of patients, enabling precision medicine
2. discovery of drugs with new mechanisms of action (MoAs) to treat patients not responsive to current therapies
3. development of drugs with improved safety profiles
4. discovery and qualification of novel biomarkers to develop prognostic, predictive, and monitoring tests
5. development of novel devices providing a nonpharmacological approach to treatment, minimally invasive monitoring of intestinal inflammation and healing, and the targeted delivery of drugs
6. development of digital health technologies to harness the power of big data and real-world evidence towards improved care and quality of life

## The gap
- understanding of IBD pathogenesis, endotypes, and potential therapeutic targets has expanded dramatically in recent decades, moving beyond canonical systemic immune pathways to encompass mucosal immunology, the microbiome, and the nervous system
- most clinical programs still focus on suppressing inflammation
    - many of these well-recognized biological drivers of IBD are not directly targeted by any available therapy

## Biomarkers for Prognosis, Treatment Response Prediction, and Monitoring
- need tools for early stratification of patients for therapies
    - biologics
    - Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors
    - future therapies

### Prognosis and prediction of treatment response
- discovery of new biomarkers
- tests not in use because of uncertainty in accuracy

### Noninvasive monitoring
- newer solutions
    - Ulcerative Colitis Response Index, a novel panel of blood neutrophil markers developed by Glycominds
    - Blood-based protein panel tests to monitor inflammation and healing have been developed for CD39 and for UC.
