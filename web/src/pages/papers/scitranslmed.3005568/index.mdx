# Cell-Based Therapeutics: The Next Pillar of Medicine (2013)

- Key step that will _enable the emergence of cell therapy_: **development of cellular engineering as a foundational science**
- Cellular engineering tools:
    - mechanisms for editing and recoding genomes
    - a toolkit of molecular parts and regulatory modules that behave predictably
    - systems-based theoretical framework for tuning and optimizing cellular behaviors

## Why cells are suited for therapeutics
- Cells naturally perform therapeutic tasks.
    - e.g. macrophages
    - e.g. stem cells
    - e.g. pancreatic $\beta$ cells
    - e.g. gut bacteria
- Cell behavior is selective.
- Cells are special delivery agents.

## (Three) Killer apps for cell therapy
- Not discussed in this paper:
    - Stem cell therapies
    - Dendritic-cell therapies

### 1. Immune cells that seek and destroy cancer
- Well-suited because cancer constantly changes.
- "Future" improvements
    - CAR-T cells also counteract adverse side effects
        - e.g. **cytokine storm** <RA /> produce anti-IL6 antibody

### 2. Bacterial treatment for Crohn's disease
- Fecal transplants to change microbiota without (or limiting) the use of antibiotics.

### 3. Combining bacterial and mammalian cell therapeutics
- e.g. Treatment of [metabolic syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916).

## Making cell therapeutics safe
- Any new therapy needs to consider **safety** and **efficacy**.
- Predictions
    - More effort needed to engineer therapeutics
    - Cell-therapies less likely to have unanticipated late-stage problems
- Advantages of cell-therapies
    1. The lifetime of a cell can be carefully controlled
    2. Better odds in the therapeutic development pipeline
        - Cell therapies have the option of adding more regulatory circuits

## Building a foundation
- A cellular engineer's toolbox needs to include
    1. **control over cell proliferation** in order to ensure survival upon implantation.
    2. **control over cell death**, both by self-regulated mechanisms and by externally-regulated safety-switch mechanisms
    3. the ability to **redirect cellular migration and movement** toward specific signals and sites teh body where the cells should execute their action
    4. **quantitative control of therapeutic responses**
    5. **specific control of the type of therapeutic response**
    6. the ability to **reprogram cell communication**
    7. **on demand production and secretion of small molecules and biologics** extending beyond the molecules a cell naturally makes
    8. development of systematic strategies and intuition for tuning and reshaping cellular behaviors
